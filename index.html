        <section>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Get to know them professionally and in person, directly or indirectly</b></li>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investigate</li>
                </ul>

<p>A Technical Writer is like a journalist – we can sniff information from different sources better than anyone else. A private profile in social media? It is not a problem for us – we can still find some important data on the web that we can later use to approach an SME from a different perspective. There is always something online about a person these days.</p>

<p>At the same time, ask your and his/her colleagues from work questions on what kind of person he/she is. Find out as much as possible about what he/she likes or dislikes privately and what style of work he/she prefers.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Take some quality time together</li>
</ul>

<p>SMEs tend to be very busy persons. First, always try to invite them for a coffee (or so, even online) or to have some Playstation time (when in the office) before getting down to more serious stuff. Even short time off work for small talk will be a good way to break the ice and get to know each other better.</p>

<li><b>Be prepared for the job</b></li><br>
<ul>
    <li>First minute as the best saving method</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not leave everything to the last minute. Start contacting your SME early or you can miss the deadline.</p>

<p>Learn as much as possible about the product/job to be done from other sources (intranet, product files, etc.). Do not ask your SME any questions for which the answers can be easily found elsewhere. This will show respect to the precious time of SME and will let you obtain more information (hidden from the outside world) from him/her in a time-limited slot.</p>

<li><b>Try out different communication channels</b></li>

<p>Do not write tens of emails if you do not get any reply from an SME – open a chat or give him/her a call. Check what he/she prefers. But – most of all – do not do it often! Do not attack him/her with your messages. An angry SME may become your antagonist.</p>

<li><b>Show the value of your job to SME and offer assistance</b></li>

<p>People tend to be more supportive and willing to meet or share information if they know they will get something in return. That’s why try to convince the SME that it is a win-win situation for both of you because a good documentation is a knowledge base: once recorded, you or anyone else will never ask the same questions to the SME again, thus saving his/her time! You can also offer to help SME with some small tasks. Such assistance is always appreciated.</p>

<li><b>Develop a cordial relationship</b></li>

<p>Do not get discouraged when being turned down with the constant unavailability of an SME or his/her repulsive behaviour. Always be kind, smile or reply politely. In the end, he/she will melt away.</p>

<li><b>Be specific</b></li>   

<p>Soft skills are important, but so are deadlines. Be precise in your communication with the SME. Instead of writing:</p>

<p>“I have a job to do. Could you help me?”</p> 

<p>write: </p>

<p>“I need to have it done by this Friday and I cannot do it without your assistance”.</p>

<li><b>Say Thank you!</b></li>

<p>If the cooperation was productive, give kudos to the SME: in the office it can be on a small note sticked to the screen (saying “Thank you for cooperation!”); in home office – kudos can be made in the intranet (e.g. by giving out a badge for everyone to see). It is also nice to leave a small gift, e.g. a chocolate or whatever this person is fond of, on the keyboard. </p>

<li><b>Contact their manager</b></li>

<p>It is not a recommended way of proceeding but it is the only way out if every other method has failed. However, do not complain to the manager saying: he/she has not replied and does not want to work with me. Instead ask if there is anyone else who may help you because this SME is lately very busy. This solution can prove right: the initial SME will contact you quickly, although the relationship may be far from perfect. But still – you have a job to do as well.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>And, last but not least, I know from my experience how easy it is to get put off by someone not trying to find out what style of working your SME has and what kind of person he/she is. In my present job I have an SME-like role and I have been unwilling to help those who are bombarding me on Jabber when all I can see when I turn on my laptop is tens of blinking messages, contacting me on chat when my status is In a meeting or asking me constantly “Have you already done it?”.</p>

<p>RESPECT should be on top of our minds. We are all in the same boat, but it will lead us nowhere if we do not show respect to the other person!</p>
