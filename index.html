        <h3>Here are my tips & tricks on how to deal with a difficult SME:</h3>
        </main>

        <section>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Get to know them professionally and in person, directly or indirectly</b></li>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Investigate</u></li>
                </ul>

                <p>A Technical Writer is like a journalist. You can get information from different sources better than anyone else.</p> 
                
                <p>A private profile in social media? No problem. You can still find important data on the web that you can later use to approach an SME from a different perspective.</p>

                <p>At the same time, ask your SME and their colleagues what kind of person they are. Find out as much as possible about what they like or dislike privately and what style of work they prefer.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><u>Spend some quality time together</u></li>
        </ul>

                <p>SMEs tend to be very busy persons.</p>

                <p>First, always try to invite them for a coffee (or so, even online) or Playstation (when in the office) before getting down to more serious stuff. Even short time off work for a small talk will be a good way to break the ice and get to know each other better.</p>

        <li><b>Be prepared for the job</b></li><br>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Save time and effort at the first minute</u></li>
            </ul>

                <p>Don't leave everything to the last minute. Start contacting your SME early or you can miss the deadline.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u>Investigate again </u>   
                </li>
             </ul>

                <p>Learn as much as possible about the product/job to be done from other sources (e.g. intranet, product files).</p>
                <p>Don't ask your SME any questions to which you can easily find answers. You will show respect for the precious time of SME and be able to obtain more information (hidden from the outside world) in a time-limited slot.</p>

        <li><b>Try out different communication channels</b></li>

                <p>Don't write tens of emails if you don't get any reply from an SME. Instead, open a chat or give them a call. Check what they prefer.</p>
                <p>But don't do it often! Don't attack them with your messages. An angry SME may become your antagonist.</p>

        <li><b>Show the value of your job to SME and offer assistance</b></li>

                <p>People tend to be more supportive and willing to meet or share information if they know they will get something in return.</p>
                <p>Thatâ€™s why you should try to convince your SME that it is a win-win situation for both of you because a good documentation is a knowledge base. Once recorded, you or anyone else will never ask the same questions to the SME again, saving their time!</p>
                <p>You can also offer to help SME with some small tasks. They will surely appreciate such assistance.</p>

        <li><b>Develop a cordial relationship</b></li>

                <p>Don't get discouraged when your SME turns you down because of their unavailability or repulsive behaviour. Always be kind, smile or reply politely. In the end, they will melt away.</p>

        <li><b>Be specific</b></li>   

                <p>Soft skills are important, but so are deadlines. Be precise in your communication with the SME. Instead of writing:</p>

                <p><i>I have a job to do. Could you please help me?</i></p> 

                <p>write: </p>

                <p><i>I need to have it done by this Friday and I can't do it without your assistance.</i></p>

        <li><b>Say <i>Thank you!</i></b></li>

                <p>If you are happy with the cooperation, give kudos to the SME. In the office it can be a small note sticked to the screen (saying <i>Thank you for cooperation!</i>). In home office you can give kudos in the intranet (e.g. by giving out a badge for everyone to see).</p> 
                <p>It is also nice to leave a small gift, e.g. a chocolate or beer or whatever this person is fond of, on the keyboard. </p>

        <li><b>Contact the manager</b></li>

                <p>I don't recommend such way of proceeding but it is the only way out if every other method has failed.</p>
                <p>However, don't complain to the manager by saying:</p>
                <p><i>... has not replied and does not want to work with me.</i></p>
                <p>Instead ask if anyone else is there to help you because this SME is lately very busy. This solution can prove right: the initial SME will contact you quickly. Although the relationship may be far from perfect, you still have a job to do.</p>
    </ol>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>I know from my experience how easy it is to get put off by someone not trying to find out what style of working your SME has and what kind of person they are.</p>
                <p>In my job I have an SME-like role and I have been unwilling to help those who are bombarding me on the corporate messenger. I don't like seeing tens of blinking messages when my status is <i>In a meeting</i> or being asked constantly <i>Have you already done it?</i>.</p>

                <p><b>RESPECT </b>should be on top of our minds. We are all in the same boat, but it will lead us nowhere if we don't show respect to the other person!</p>
